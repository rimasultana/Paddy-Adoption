# Pet Adoption Platform

A fully responsive pet adoption platform designed based on a Figma design, featuring dynamic categories, sorting functionality, and an adoption process. Built using Tailwind CSS, DaisyUI, and ES6 JavaScript.

## Key Features
1. **Responsive Navbar**: A mobile-friendly, collapsible navbar that adapts across all device sizes (Desktop, Tablet, Mobile).
2. **Dynamic Categories**: Fetches categories from an API and displays them, allowing users to filter pets by category.
3. **Adopt Your Best Friend Section**: Shows pets with details like breed, birth date, gender, and price. Users can "Like," "Adopt," or view more details about each pet.
4. **Adopt Process with Countdown**: Includes a 3-second countdown when a user clicks "Adopt," changing the button text to "Adopted."
5. **Modal View for Pet Details**: Displays full pet information in a modal window when the "Details" button is clicked.

## ES6 Features Used
- Arrow functions for concise callbacks and event handling.
- `let` and `const` for block-scoped variable declarations.
- Template literals for dynamic HTML generation.
- Promises and async/await for API calls.
